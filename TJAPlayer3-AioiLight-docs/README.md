* GitHub Pages site version: [TJAPlayer3-AioiLight-docs/](https://iepiweidieng.github.io/TJAPlayer3/TJAPlayer3-AioiLight-docs/)

An unofficial archive of AioiLight's documentation for TJAPlayer3, from Internet Archive:
<https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aioilight.space/taiko/tjap3*>

These documentation pages were authored and maintained by AioiLight (the former main maintainer of TJAPlayer3), and have been archived by Internet Archive.

However, the original archived version is not browsable due to a CSS styling issue which makes the page content invisible. This modified archived version fixed this styling issue.

These page files were saved using Microsoft Edge, after:
  * add `style="visibility: visible;"` to the `<html>` HTML tag using DevTools
  * close the Wayback Machine toolbar by clicking the close button
  * choose a filename which is consistent with the URL

Non-date, non-tag links were re-pointed to this archive if the target page has been archived here.
